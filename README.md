## Hi there 👋

## 👨‍💻 Introduction
I'm a creative technologist with over 17 years of experience crafting web solutions and guiding businesses through digital transformations. Since **2007**, I’ve been hands-on with front-end development and CMS integration.  

Trusted by startups and established enterprises to completely revamp their digital presence, from **strategic restructuring** to **redesigning and rebuilding** their web platforms from the ground up.

## 💼 Projects
I've delivered over 30 tailored projects, each reflecting a commitment to clarity, efficiency, and purposeful design. I approach each project with a pixel-perfect mindset. Digital products that feel crafted and not just assembled. You can check out some of those [projects here](https://www.behance.net/lichtwald).
