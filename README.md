## Hi there 👋

I'm a creative technologist with over 17 years of experience crafting individual web solutions and guiding businesses through digital transformations. Since **2007**, I’ve been hands-on with front-end development, server management, and CMS integration—crafting intuitive digital experiences backed by robust infrastructure. Beyond building interfaces, I’ve been trusted by ambitious startups and established enterprises to completely revamp their digital presence—from strategic restructuring to redesigning and rebuilding their web platforms from the ground up.

I've delivered over 30 tailored projects, each reflecting a commitment to clarity, efficiency, and purposeful design. For me, software design is more than aesthetics—it's about balance, clarity, and cohesion. I approach each project with a pixel-perfect mindset. Structure matters. Speed matters. Detail matters. Digital products that feel crafted—not just assembled.
